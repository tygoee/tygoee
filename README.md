### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tygo, 15 years old and a learning programmer with some small projects.
Coding is my passion and I'm trying to learn becoming a developer.
Currently I'm working on multiple repositories, making new ones pretty often and
if you need a collaborator, I'd like to help, you can reach me on discord: [@tygoe](https://discord.com/users/827499956394786826) :)
