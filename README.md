### Hi there 👋

I'm Tygo, 14 years old and a learning programmer with some small projects. 
For coding I have a passion and I'm trying to learn to become a developer as a job.
Currently I'm working on multiple repositories, making new ones pretty often and
if you need a collaborator, I'd like to help; you can reach me on discord: [@tygoe](https://discord.com/users/827499956394786826) :)
